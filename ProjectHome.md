**Digger** is a highly distributed active querying system for continuous lookups of domain names.

Digger queries domains using a list of publicly accessible recursive resolvers and on the DNS resolver local to each prober node.

Detailed information about DNS resolutions are stored in raw format, as well as condensed into a relational database to enable flexible analysis.

We are currently writing a detailed description of how Digger works. The complete system documentation will be available soon. In the meanwhile, please refer to the Wiki and contact us if you have any questions.
